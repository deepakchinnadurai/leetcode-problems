// You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

// Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

 

// Example 1:

// Input: n = 2
// Output: 2
// Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
// 1. 1 step + 1 step
// 2. 2 steps


class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if(n==1) return 1;
        int first = 1;
        int second = 2;
        for(int i=3;i<=n;i++){
            int third = first + second;
            first = second;
            second = third;
        }
